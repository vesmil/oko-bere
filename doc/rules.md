# Rules

Oko bere is usually played with a deck of 32 cards (7, 8, 9, 10, jacks, queens, kings and aces in hearts, clubs, crosses and spades). The game is controlled by the ``banker`` - a player who holds the `bank` and deals cards. It is either agreed upon by the players or drawn from the deck of cards (the highest card gives). 

*A minimum amount for setting up a bank and minimal bet size is usually determined before the game.*

## Rounds

**At the start of each round** the `banker` asks one player to slice the deck. This could result in `duel` if both side agree - that means the following round will be only between the two of them. The player bets certain amount and the card at the bottom of sliced counts as first card for both. The bet in this case can't be increased and the cards can't be exchanged. It's important that the `banker` has the right to decline offer after hearing initial bet size.

If the duel wasn't started, the banker deals each player, including himself, one card. The first player on the right side of player slicing starts. **The goal of the game** then for each player is to reach or get as close as possible to a total of twenty-one without overdrawing. 

The player has three options during his turn - draw another card, bet or stop. He can draw any number of cards as long as he is satisfied with his total and didn't overdraw 21 - if he overdraws, he immediately loses his bet, which goes to the bank. If he does not want to risk further - he announces "enough".

The player can also before drawing each card increase his bet. Whenever player bets, the `banker` adds the same amount to the bet from the bank. Winnings are therefore paid out as an equal bet with a payout ratio of 1:1 and it is possible to bet up to the bank.

**At the end of the round**, when the game reaches the `banker`, he has the similar options as the other players. He can ask for cards or stop. In case the banker overdraws, he looses all active bets. If he decides to stop, each active bet is resolved - if the player has less or the same amount as `banker`, the money goes to the bank. Otherwise the player wins.

## Card values

**The card values** are following:

- Cards with number on them have that number's value - with the exception **7 of hearts** (also called `šantala`) which can be worth 7, 10 or 11 according to what is most beneficial for the player

- Images (J, Q, K) are worth 1

- Aces are worth 11

### Special cases

* When someone receives two aces or ace and `šantala` he automatically wins independently of hand of the other side

* If the player (including banker) has on of the following hands, he can ask to get his cards replced:
  
  * First card seven
  
  * First card eight followed by seven
  
  * Five images
  
  * Cards which totals to 15

## End of the game

The game can end in two ways - the `bank` is empty or the the `banker` calls `malá domů`.

### Empty banks

In this case, the players decide whether they want to continue. If they do, the `banker` is the last player that placed the last bet which emptied out the `bank`.

### Malá domů

This is when the `banker` wants to keep the `bank`. If the bank is double the initial size and the `banker` is satisfied he can at the start of the round call `malá domů`, that means if he receives an eight or a king as his first card he keeps the bank and new banker is drawn. If he received other card the game continues normal way.
