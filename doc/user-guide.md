# User guide

User guide is separated into two parts as usually more people will be interested in the client part.

---

## Client side

*This part includes both connection to the server and game controls.*

### Connection

User needs to specify Ip, port and name in a simple connection dialog.

### Controls

Controls are rather simple - user simply uses his mouse cursor according to the instructions on the top bar.

However, It is recommended to get familiar with game rules beforehand.

---

## Server side

*This part includes info about server configuration.*

## Setup server

Usage of server in it's current form is straight forward.

You simply have to run the program and for convenience it will write you ip adress to the console.
